# Enable remote access to LAN Devices via LarePass VPN

LarePass VPN allows you to access your Olares device and its local network devices from a different network segment or a remote location. By enabling SSH access and subnet routing, you can remotely manage devices like PCs, printers, or NAS systems in your Olares LAN.

:::info
Only Olares admin can enable remote access to LAN Devices via LarePass VPN.

Devices with activated VPN will use the VPN connection to access Olares, whether through the LarePass client or a browser.

:::info
iOS or macOS versions of LarePass will require adding a VPN configuration file to the system when turning on the VPN. Follow the prompts to complete the setup.

## Allow SSH connections via VPN
This enables SSH access to your Olares device through the LarePass VPN, even when you are in a different network or working remotely.

1. Open the Settings app, and select **System** > **VPN**.
2. Toggle on **Allow SSH Access via VPN**. Port **22** (SSH) is automatically added to the configuration.

## Allow subnet routing
This feature allows you to access other devices in the same local network as your Olares through the VPN.

1. Open the Settings app, and select **System** > **VPN**.
2. Toggle on **Enable subnet routes**.

## Configure ACL rules for port access
After enabling subnet routing, you can further configure ACL (Access Control List) rules to allow traffic to specific ports based on the services you want to access.

For example, to access a Windows server via Remote Desktop:
1. Click <i class="material-symbols-outlined">add</i> to open the **Add ACL** dialog.
2. Enter `3389` (default port for Remote Desktop Protocol), and click **Confirm**.
3. Click **Apply** to apply changes.

Now you can use Windows Remote Desktop to access the Windows server in the same LAN as Olares.

# Filtered view examples
This guide provides examples of filter queries for Wise. Each example addresses a specific use case, making it easy to organize, sort, and rediscover content in your library.

## Focus on unread entries from a specific feed
Want to catch up on just one feed? Use this query to display all unread entries from a particular source.
```
feed_id:12345 AND seen:false
```

## See everything by your favorite author
Easily pull up all entries written by a specific author you love.
```
author:"John Doe"
```
This shows all documents where the author is "John Doe" so you can stay up-to-date with a writer's work.

## Stay up-to-date with the latest content
Only want to see new articles? Filter for content published after a specific date.
```
published_at__gt:2025-04-01
```
This query displays entries published after April 1, 2025. It's a great way to focus on fresh updates and avoid getting lost in older material.

## Review saved content with notes
Use this query to find tagged entries that include your own notes:
```
tag:AI AND has:note
```
This is useful for revisiting saved content where you've added personal insights or comments.

## Prioritize tagged "Read Later" entries
Need to focus on specific topics? This filter shows all your "Read Later" entries with a particular tag.
```
tag:Work AND location:readlater
```
This pulls up all entries tagged with "Work" that are saved to your "Read Later" list. It's perfect for tackling important projects or topics you've set aside.

## Clean up your inbox with unread videos
Want to catch up on videos from your RSS feeds? This filter focuses on unwatched content.

```
file_type:video AND seen:false AND isfeed:true
```
This shows all unread video entries from your subscribed feeds. It's ideal for binge-watching or sorting through your video backlog.

## Revisit entries you haven't opened in months
Got old productivity-related entries that you haven't touched in a while? This filter helps you rediscover them.

```
last_opened__lt:2023-12-31 AND tag:Productivity
```
This shows all entries that you last opened before December 31, 2023. You can revisit useful content you've saved for productivity but might have forgotten aboutâ€”or decide if it's time to delete it.

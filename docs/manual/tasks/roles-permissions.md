# User roles and permissions

Olares supports multi-user operations, allowing multiple users to access the system simultaneously. Each user can securely access resources based on their assigned role and permissions.

## Role types
Olares has two default user roles:
- **Admin**: Automatically assigned to the first user who activates and logs into Olares
- **Member**: Standard user role with limited permissions

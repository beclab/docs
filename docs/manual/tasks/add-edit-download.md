# Add, edit, and download
Operations in Files are essentially the same as in other file managers. This page will introduce some common tasks in Files to get you started.

## Upload files

1. Open the Files app from the Dock or Launchpad on Olares.
2. Upload multiple files or folders using one of these methods:
   - Drag and drop files from your local file manager into the Files window. 
   - Click <i class="material-symbols-outlined">drive_folder_upload</i> in the top right corner. 
   - Right-click in an empty space and select from the context menu.

:::info
Files supports resumable uploads. If an upload is interrupted, it will automatically resume from the last checkpoint.

## Download files
When downloading multiple files, the behavior differs between the Files in Olares and LarePass desktop application.
* **Files in Olares (web interface)**: Automatically packages files into a zip file for download, requiring manual extraction.
* **LarePass desktop**: Downloads are queued, allowing you to pause, resume, or cancel tasks, and easily locate downloaded files.
:::tip
For large files or multiple downloads, it's recommended to use the LarePass desktop application for more powerful download management and a better user experience. Visit the [official page](https://www.olares.xyz/larepass) for details and download options.

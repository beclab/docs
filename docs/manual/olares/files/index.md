# Manage files

Olares's built-in Files app offers users a secure and efficient solution for file storage and synchronization, allowing access to various file types from any device or browser. It has the following advantages:

* **Access anywhere**: View, download, or share files stored in Olares from any location using any device or browser.
* **Seamless synchronization**: Ensures data remains up-to-date across all your devices.
* **Centralized storage**: Simplifies information retrieval and integration, making it easier to access, manage, and update your data, whether personal documents or team-shared materials.

## Understand the interface
The interface is similar to Windows Explorer or macOS Finder, allowing you to organize and access documents, images, videos, or any other files you own.
It consists of three main components:

* **Drive**: For storing files that don't require frequent synchronization or modifications.
* **Sync**: For syncing files and directories across devices.
* **Application**: For development and debugging purposes only.
* **CloudDrive**: For mounting and accessing your cloud storage services including Google Drive, AWS S3, Tencent Cloud Object Storage (COS)

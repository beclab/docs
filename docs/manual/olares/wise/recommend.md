# Discover themed content
Most digital platforms control what content you see through centralized recommendation systems that collect and analyze your data. Wise offers a different approach - you choose and run recommendation algorithms directly on your device, keeping your reading preferences and interactions completely private while still enjoying personalized content discovery.
## How self-hosted recommendation works
Content recommendation in Wise happens in two distinct stages:

1. Content providers collect and package global content in the cloud.
2. Your Olares device downloads this content and processes it locally using your chosen recommendation algorithms.

Since every device receives the same content data and processes recommendations offline, your reading preferences and interaction data remain completely private. You can monitor these recommendation workflows through a visual interface that shows exactly how your content is being processed.

As you continue to read and bookmark content in Wise, the algorithm learns your preferences and improves its recommendation accuracy over time.

## Install a recommendation algorithm
To start receiving personalized content recommendations:

1. In Market, browse the **Recommendation** category for a topic that interests you.
2. Click **Get** to install your chosen algorithm.
3. Allow some time for the algorithm to complete its local recommendation workflow.

Once installed, find your recommended content on the **For you** page in Wise. This page displays results from all your installed recommendation algorithms, with separate content feeds for each. Switch between different algorithms by clicking the recommendation title at the top.

## FAQ

### Why can't I see recommended content after installation?
If you've just installed a recommendation algorithm, you'll need to wait briefly while it completes the local recommendation workflow on your Olares. This ensures all processing happens locally to protect your privacy.

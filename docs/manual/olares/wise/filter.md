# Organize your knowledge with filters

As your Wise library grows, staying organized can become challenging. With filtered views, you can easily sort and access content by applying filters based on parameters like tags, saved dates, authors, and more.

This guide covers how to:
- Create filtered views from tags and subscribed feeds.
- Add custom filtered views using queries.

Only entries from feeds or entries saved to **<i class="material-symbols-outlined">inbox</i> Inbox** or **<i class="material-symbols-outlined">schedule</i> Read Later** can be queried.

## Use tags or feeds to filter entries
Filtered views allow you to organize your content by grouping entries based on tags or feeds. This helps you quickly access content related to specific topics or sources.

1. Open Wise, click <i class="material-symbols-outlined">settings</i> in the bottom left corner.
2. Depending on your preference:
   - Select **Tags** to filter content by specific topics or categories.
   - Select **RSS feeds** to filter content from specific sources.
3. For existing tags, click **Manage views...**. You can:
   - Group content from the tag or feed into an existing view, or
   - Create a new view to group all related content.

4. If creating a new view:
    - Enter a name for the view (e.g., `Tech Articles`).
    - Click **Confirm** to save the view.

## Add custom filter view
For more flexibility, you can create custom filtered views using query language. This allows you to define precise conditions for grouping content.

The following demonstrates how to create a view for the tag "AI" using query language:

1. Open Wise, click <i class="material-symbols-outlined">settings</i> in the bottom left corner and select **Filtered views**.
2. In the top-right corner, select **Add view**.
3. Enter a name for the view (e.g., "AI trends"), and enter `tag:AI` in the **Query** filed.
4. Click **Confirm** to save this view.

## Pin views to sidebar
You can pin filtered views to the sidebar using either of these methods:

- Locate the view in the list and click <i class="material-symbols-outlined">keep</i> in the corresponding **Operations** column.
- Open the filtered view, click <i class="material-symbols-outlined">keyboard_arrow_down</i> in the header, and select **Pin to sidebar**.

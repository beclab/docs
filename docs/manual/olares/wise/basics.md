# Wise basics

Wise helps you curate and organize your reading materials with flexible options for collecting, reading, and managing content. This page covers the essential tasks to get you started with Wise.

## Add content to your library
Save interesting content using any of these methods.

### Add to Inbox or Read Later
Organize your reading flow with two collections:

* **Inbox**: Your primary collection for content you want to read soon.
* **Read Later**: Your backlog for content to revisit in the future.

While browsing the title or reading, click **<i class="material-symbols-outlined">inbox</i> Inbox** or **<i class="material-symbols-outlined">schedule</i> Read Later** to save content to either collection.

## Automatic download
Wise automatically creates download tasks for new audio or video content, saving media files to Olares for convenient offline access.

This feature:

* Ensures your content is always available offline
* Prevents content loss if the original source becomes unavailable
* Provides quick access to your media files

To view all your downloaded media files, go to <i class="material-symbols-outlined">settings</i> > **Transmission** > **Download**. This page shows a complete list of your downloads along with their details.

### Track your reading progress
Wise uses green dot indicators on article covers to help you track unread content. When you open an article, it's automatically marked as read.

While reading, you can manually toggle between **<i class="material-symbols-outlined">playlist_add_check</i>Seen** or **<i class="material-symbols-outlined">playlist_remove</i>Unseen** status in the toolbar to maintain your reading progress.

# Collaborate in Olares
Olares helps teams work together efficiently while maintaining data privacy. Set up your collaborative workspace with some essential features.

## Access and share files in Files

Files provides both personal and shared storage spaces:

* Create shared libraries for team documents and assets.
* Set granular access permissions for different team members.
* Access files seamlessly across desktop and mobile devices.

For details, see [Sync and share files](./files/sync-share.md).

## Store and share sensitive information in Vault
Vault lets you store and share sensitive data within your team:

* Share passwords and credentials securely with team members.
* Create separate vaults for different projects.
* Keep sensitive data private with end-to-end encryption.
* Access shared credentials across desktop and mobile devices.

For details, see [Share vault items](./vault/share-vault-items.md).

## Set up application entrances
Give your team flexible ways to access applications through public and private entrances. Public entrances are ideal for team services open to the world (like public websites), while private entrances ensure secure access to internal tools or assets. You can:

* Replace default route IDs with memorable custom ones (like changing `de463205` to `team-wiki`).
* Set up custom domains for easier team access.

For details, see [Customize application URLs](./settings/custom-app-domain.md).
## Simplify remote access with VPN
When your team works remotely, accessing Olares usually requires going through public networks - which means using services like Cloudflare and dealing with complex network setups. Olares's built-in VPN offers a simpler way:

* All team members can access applications on different devices using simple local addresses.
* Instead of going through public networks, connections stay within internal network, making it faster and reducing your public network usage costs.

For details, see [Access Olares applications on other devices via VPN](/manual/larepass/private-network.md).

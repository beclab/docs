# ComfyUI

ComfyUI is a powerful node-based interface for Stable Diffusion that transforms AI image generation into a visual programming experience. By connecting different nodes together like building blocks, you gain precise control over every aspect of the generation process - from prompts and models to post-processing effects.

Unlike the straightforward interface of SD Web UI, ComfyUI lets you create custom workflows by connecting nodes that represent different operations. This approach gives you deeper control over the image generation pipeline while making complex operations reusable and shareable.

## What can ComfyUI do?
ComfyUI puts advanced AI image generation capabilities at your fingertips:

* Create reusable workflows by connecting nodes visually
* Fine-tune every aspect of the generation process
* Mix and match different models and techniques
* Save and share your custom workflows with others
* Batch process images with consistent settings
* Apply advanced post-processing effects

## Install ComfyUI

Based on your role:
* **For admin**: Install both "ComfyUI For Cluster" and "ComfyUI".
* **For team members**: Ensure your admin has installed "ComfyUI For Cluster", and install "ComfyUI" only.

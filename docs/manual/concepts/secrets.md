# Secrets

Olares categorizes secrets based on usage scenarios and employs various management techniques.

|             | Data Type                                                                            | Storage Location                    | Leak Risk                                                                            | Usage                                                                                                                  |
|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Vault items | Includes website and database passwords, blockchain private keys, etc.               | Vault                               | Encrypted data in Olares ensures that third parties cannot view even upon logging in | Each use requires a signature from LarePass                                                                            |
| Credentials | System access credentials obtained post-secure authentication: Tokens, Cookies, etc. | [Infisical](https://infisical.com/) | Viewable by third parties post-authentication in Olares by following specific steps  | Available to applications through an API after obtaining Provider permissions                                          |
| Secret      | Sensitive data used in Pod containers, like database connections and admin accounts  | ETCD                                | Directly visible in [Control Hub](../tasks/navigate-control-hub#secrets)             | Used in Helm deployment templates; secret values are injected into environment variables via valueFrom -> secretKeyRef |

## Integration credential 

Users can enable applications within Olares to access external service credentials by logging into third-party service accounts through Settings. Examples include:

- Logging in to Olares Space allows the backup service to request tokens for automated backend backups.
- Logging into Google enables Files to synchronize with data from Google Drive.

Applications in Olares can retrieve these third-party service credentials via the [Service Provider](../../developer/develop/advanced/provider.md).

## Application credential

- Applications within Olares can manage and utilize [credentials](../../developer/develop/advanced/secret.md) via system-provided interfaces.
- Credentials generated by an application are exclusively restricted to that application's use.

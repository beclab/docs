## What is the relationship with WorldCoin?

World ID is a privacy-preserving proof of personhood. It is issued by the **Worldcoin protocol**, allowing individuals to prove they are human to any verifier (including Web2 applications) while maintaining privacy through **zero-knowledge proofs**.

From the perspective of the **Olares ID**, World ID is a type of **Verifiable Credential (VC)** that proves the holder is a "natural person." We plan to introduce World ID into **LarePass** in the future. For more details, please refer to the [Worldcoin website](https://worldcoin.org/).

## What are the differences among DID Metadata, VC, and Reputation?

- **DID Metadata** are DID related data stored on the **DID Registry**. It consists of declarations made by the entity about themselves. It serves as self-reported data.
- **Verifiable Credentials (VCs)** are issued by one entity about another, often encapsulating objective data such as age or educational qualifications. VCs are cryptographically secure and verifiable.
- **Reputation** aggregates subjective evaluations of an entity from various sources, allowing for a more nuanced interpretation that can incorporate potential inaccuracies, biases, or opinions.

## C
### CNAME Record
A CNAME (Canonical Name) record is a type of DNS (Domain Name System) record that maps your custom domain name to an Olares-provided address, enabling domain-to-application mapping.

## D
### DID
A Decentralized Identifier (DID) is a unique digital identification method that enables any person or entity to have a persistent, unique identity on the network. This identifier is fully independent and doesn't require verification or registration through a central authority. A DID is a unique string that starts with "did" and follows specific formatting and naming conventions.

## F
### FRP
Fast Reverse Proxy (FRP) is a high-performance reverse proxy application designed for internal network penetration scenarios. It enables servers behind NAT or firewalls to provide services externally, even without public IP addresses. FRP helps users easily expose internal services to the public network.

## T
### TOTP
Time-Based One-Time Password (TOTP) is a time-based algorithm for generating one-time passwords, widely used in two-factor authentication (2FA). It generates single-use passwords using a shared key and current time to enhance account security. Each password is valid for a brief period (typically 30 or 60 seconds) before a new one is generated.

## V
### VC
Verifiable Credential (VC) is a digital format proof that verifies certain attributes or qualifications of its holder without revealing additional personal information. It involves three primary roles:

* Holder: The individual who possesses and uses the credential to prove certain information
* Issuer: The authority or entity that creates and issues verifiable credentials
* Verifier: The individual or organization that needs to verify the authenticity of the holder's information by validating the credential

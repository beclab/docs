# Manage knowledge with LarePass

LarePass lets you capture and manage knowledge from across the web, whether it's articles, podcasts, videos, or RSS feeds. With the browser extension and mobile app, you can collect content in just a few clicks and sync it seamlessly with **Wise**, the knowledge management app in Olares.

This guide walks you through how to collect content using the **LarePass extension** and **mobile client**, and how to subscribe to RSS feeds for continuous content updates. 

Learn more about organizing and using your content in the [Wise guide](../olares/wise/).

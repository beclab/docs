3. Restart Steam to view your complete game library.  

## Configure the streaming service

To stream games using Moonlight, you need to pair your client device with the Sunshine streaming server integrated in Steam Headless. 

### Prepare for paring

1. From your Steam page in the browser, get the URL and append `:47990`, for example, `https://139ebc4f0.local.<your-olares-name>.olares.com:47990`. Open this URL to access the Sunshine console page.

   Do not include `https://` and make sure to include the `.local` part in the hostname.

### Stream remotely 

With Olares's VPN feature, you can enjoy a smooth streaming experience even across different networks.

To enable the VPN:

<!--@include: ./remote.reusables.md{4,21}-->

Once VPN is enabled on your device, simply follow the same instructions as local streaming.

## FAQs

### Why isn’t the game displaying in full screen?

This could be due to your resolution settings. Try adjusting the resolution:
- In Moonlight: adjust in **Settings** > **Basic Settings** > **Resolution and FPS**.
- On the Steam Headless console page: adjust in **Applications** > **Settings** > **Display**.

After finishing your streaming session, exit the Steam Big Picture mode to release system resources on Olares.

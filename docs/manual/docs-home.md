## What is Olares?
Olares is an open-source sovereign cloud operating system built for local AI. It turns your hardware into a private, scalable, and AI-ready environment, making it easy to run local AI applications, self-host services, manage files, or collaborate securely with your team.

With Olares, self-hosting is no longer a daunting task. It simplifies complex processes like network setup, domain management, and service orchestration, enabling both beginners or experienced users to focus on what truly matters.

Privacy and independence are at the core of Olares. It is perfect for individuals or teams who want to avoid relying on centralized platforms. Your data stays on your hardware, and all tasks are processed locally, so your sensitive information never leaves your control. Olares gives you complete ownership of your data and infrastructure without sacrificing performance or simplicity.

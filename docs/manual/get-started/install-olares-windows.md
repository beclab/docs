# Install Olares on Windows

Olares is designed to run on Linux-based systems. However, you can also install it on macOS or Windows for testing or evaluation purposes.

Currently, Olares on Windows has certain limitations including:
- Lack of distributed storage support
- Inability to add local nodes.

We recommend using it only for development or testing purposes.

## FAQ

### How to make sure I am using PowerShell as administrator?
You can confirm that PowerShell is running as an administrator if you see "Administrator: Windows PowerShell" in the title bar of the PowerShell window.

![Confirm run Powershell as administrator](/images/manual/get-started/confirm-run-powershell-as-admin.png#bordered)

If not, use one of the following methods:
- Search for "PowerShell" in the **Start** menu, right-click it, and select **Run as administrator**.
- Or press **Win** + **R**, type `powershell`, and press **Ctrl** + **Shift** + **Enter** to open PowerShell as an administrator.

### How to configure the CPU and memory for WLS?
When installing Olares in WSL, the default memory allocation is `12GB`. But you can configure the memory before Olares installation, or adjust both memory and CPU settings after installation.

**Adjust the memory setting before installation**

For example, to allocate 16GB of memory:

1. Add a user variable with the following:
   - **Variable name**: `WSL_MEMORY`
   - **Variable value**: `16`

   ![Add user variable](/images/manual/get-started/add-user-variable.png)

2. Click **OK** to apply changes.

   :::tip
   If you already have a PowerShell window open, changes to environment variables will not take effect in the current session. To ensure the updated environment variables are loaded, open a new PowerShell terminal as administrator, and then run the installation script.
   :::

**Adjust memory and CPU settings after installation**

After installation, a configuration file named `.wslconfig` will be created in the current user's home directory (`C:\Users\<YourUsername>\`). This file allows you to adjust memory and CPU settings. The default configuration looks like this:

```bash
[wsl2]
memory=12GB
swap=0GB
```

For example, to use 4 CPU cores:
1. Add the `processors` parameter to the file:
   ```bash
   [wsl2]
   memory=12GB
   processors=4
   swap=0GB
   ```
2. Save the `.wslconfig` file with your custom changes. 
3. Close all running virtual machines by running the following command in PowerShell:
   ```powershell
   wsl --shutdown
   ```
4. Restart Olares by running:
   ```powershell
   wsl -d Ubuntu
   ```
It will take a few minutes for Olares services to restart.

### How to reactivate Olares after the PC restarts?
Run the following command in PowerShell to restart the Olares service:
```powershell
wsl -d Ubuntu
```
### How to uninstall Olares?
Run the following command in PowerShell:
```powershell
wsl --unregister ubuntu
```

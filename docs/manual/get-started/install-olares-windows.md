# Install Olares on Windows

## FAQ

### How to make sure I am using PowerShell as administrator?
You can confirm that PowerShell is running as an administrator if you see "Administrator: Windows PowerShell" in the title bar of the PowerShell window.

![Confirm run Powershell as administrator](/images/manual/get-started/confirm-run-powershell-as-admin.png#bordered)

If not, use one of the following methods:
- Search for "PowerShell" in the **Start** menu, right-click it, and select **Run as administrator**.
- Or press Win + R, type `powershell`, and press Ctrl + Shift + Enter to open PowerShell as an administrator.

### How to configure the CPU and memory for WLS?
When installing Olares in WSL, the default memory allocation is `12GB`.

To adjust the memory allocated to WSL _before installation_, add a user environment variable `WSL_MEMORY`. For example, to allocate 16GB, simply set the variable to `16`.
   :::tip
   If you already have a PowerShell window open, changes to environment variables will not take effect in the current session. To ensure the updated environment variables are loaded, open a new PowerShell terminal as administrator, and then run the installation script.
   :::

After installation, a configuration file named `.wslconfig` will be created in the current user's home directory (`C:\Users\<YourUsername>\`). This file allows you to adjust memory and CPU settings. The default configuration looks like this:

```bash
[wsl2]
memory=12GB
swap=0GB
```

For example, to use 4 CPU cores, add the `processors` parameter to the file:
```bash
[wsl2]
memory=12GB
processors=4
swap=0GB
```

To apply these changes:

1. Save the `.wslconfig` file with your custom changes. 
2. Close all running virtual machines by running the following command in PowerShell:
   ```powershell
   wsl --shutdown
   ```
3. Restart Olares by running:
   ```powershell
   wsl -d Ubuntu
   ```
It will take a few minutes for Olares services to restart.

### How to reactivate Olares after the PC restarts?
Run the following command in PowerShell to restart the Olares service:
```powershell
wsl -d Ubuntu
```

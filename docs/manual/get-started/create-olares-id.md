# Create Olares ID

An Olares ID is a unique identifier within the Olares ecosystem, serving as your digital identity and gateway to various services and features.

An Olares ID consists of a local name and a domain. For example, in `alice123@olares.com`:
- `alice123`: Local name
- `olares.com`: Domain name

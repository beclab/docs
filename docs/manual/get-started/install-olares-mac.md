# Install Olares on Mac

Olares is designed to run on Linux-based systems. However, you can also install it on macOS or Windows for testing or evaluation purposes.

:::info
Currently, Olares on Mac has certain limitations including:
- Lack of distributed storage support.
- Inability to add local nodes.

We recommend using it only for development or testing purposes.
:::
## System compatibility

- Architecture: X86-64 or ARM64
- RAM: 8 GB or above (available memory)
- Storage: 90 GB or above (available disk space)
- MacOS: Monterey (12) or later

## Before you begin
Ensure you have the following installed:
- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)

    ::: tip
    It's recommended to install via `homebrew`.

:::info Errors during installation?

```
After uninstalling, retry the installation by running the original installation command.
:::
## Prepare Wizard URL
At the end of the installation process, you will need to provide some information:
1. Check your Mac's IP address for the network gateway (e.g., `192.168.x.x`). 

   If the automatically retrieved IP address is correct, press `Y`. To enter a different one, press `R` and provide the correct address.
   ::: tip Identify your IP address
   To identify the IP address of a Mac, you can use either the Graphical User Interface (GUI) or the Command Line (CLI).
   - With GUI: Navigate to the **System Settings** (or **System Preferences**) > **Network**, and check the connection's details for the active network connection.
   - With CLI: Open a new Terminal window and use the command `ipconfig getifaddr en0` for Wi-Fi or `ipconfig getifaddr en1` for Ethernet.
   :::
2. Enter your domain name and Olares ID.

   For example, if your full Olares ID is `alice123@olares.com`:
    - **Domain name**: Press `Enter` to use the default domain name or type `olares.com`.
    - **Olares ID**: Enter the prefix of your Olares ID. In this example, enter `alice123`.

Upon completion of the installation, the initial system information, including the Wizard URL and the initial login password, will appear on the screen. You will need them later in the activation stage.

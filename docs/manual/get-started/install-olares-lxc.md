# Install Olares on LXC
Olares is designed to run on Linux-based systems and has been verified on the following platforms:

- Linux distributions: Debian, Ubuntu, Raspbian (a Debian-based system for Raspberry Pi)
- Virtualization platforms: Proxmox VE (PVE, Debian-based), LXC on PVE.

## System requirements

LXC (Linux Containers) is a lightweight virtualization method that runs applications in isolated containers. When used on PVE, it enables an efficient way to deploy Olares without the overhead of a full virtual machine.

Make sure your device meets the following requirements.

- CPU: At least 4 cores
- RAM: At least 8GB of available memory
- Storage: At least 64GB of available space (SSD recommended)
- Supported systems:
    - PVE 8.2.2
    - Linux container: Debian 12 (for existing LXC containers on PVE)

::: tip Version compatibility
While the specific versions are confirmed to work, the process may still work on other versions. Adjustments may be necessary depending on your environment. If you meet any issues with these platforms, feel free to raise an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/beclab/Olares/issues/new).
:::

## Prerequisites

-  Working directories for storing images and packages on the PVE host. You can set it using the following command:

   ``` bash
   mkdir -p /root/.olares/images /root/.olares/pkg
   ```

- The container template (CT) for `debian-12-standard_12.7-1_amd64.tar.zst`. Download it from the [PVE image repository](http://download.proxmox.com/images/system/).

## Configure the LXC environment

::: tip Install on existing LXC
To install Olares on an existing LXC container, skip to step 2 directly. Make sure you use the corresponding container ID.
:::

1. Create the LXC container using the following script:

   ::: tip Unique container ID
   To create a container, you need to assign it a unique container ID. In this guide, we use `16553`, but you can replace it with any available numeric ID. Make sure to update all commands and configurations accordingly.
   :::


   ``` bash{2}
   export ROOTPASS=123456 
   pct create 16553 /var/lib/vz/template/cache/debian-12-standard_12.7-1_amd64.tar.zst \
   --hostname olares \
   --ostype ubuntu \
   --cores 4 \
   --memory 10240 \
   --swap 0 \
   --net0 name=eth0,bridge=vmbr0,firewall=1,ip=dhcp,ip6=dhcp,type=veth \
   --rootfs local-lvm:80 \
   --unprivileged 0 \
   --ignore-unpack-errors \
   --mp0 "/root/.olares/images,mp=/root/.olares/images" \
   --mp1 "/root/.olares/pkg,mp=/root/.olares/pkg" \
   --password="$ROOTPASS"
   ``` 

2. Modify the LXC configuration.

   a. Open the configuration file using the following command:

   ``` bash
   nano /etc/pve/lxc/16553.conf
   ```

   b. Copy and paste the following configurations into the file:

   ``` bash
   arch: amd64
   cores: 4
   hostname: olares
   memory: 10240
   net0: name=eth0,bridge=vmbr0,firewall=1,hwaddr=BC:24:11:13:05:7C,ip=dhcp,ip6=dhcp,type=veth
   ostype: debian
   rootfs: local-lvm:vm-16553-disk-0,size=80G

   # Storage config
   mp0: /root/.olares/images,mp=/root/.olares/images
   mp1: /root/.olares/pkg,mp=/root/.olares/pkg

   # Permision config 
   lxc.apparmor.profile: unconfined
   lxc.cgroup.devices.allow: a
   lxc.cap.drop:
   lxc.mount.auto: "proc sys cgroup:mixed"
   ```

   c. Save and close the file.

3. Enable IP Virtual Server (IPVS) modules on the PVE host:

   ``` bash
   sudo modprobe ip_vs
   sudo modprobe ip_vs_rr
   sudo modprobe ip_vs_wrr
   sudo modprobe ip_vs_sh
   sudo modprobe overlay
   ```

4. Start the LXC container, make initial configurations, and exit:

   ```bash
   # Start the container
   pct start 16553

   # Enter the container
   pct enter 16553

   # Create missing directories
   mkdir -p /lib/modules

   # Update PATH environment variable
   echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/bin:$PATH"' >> /root/.bashrc
   source ~/.bashrc
   
   # exit LXC
   exit
   ```

5. Copy PVE dependencies to the LXC container:

   ``` bash
   # Copy kernel config from PVE host to LXC container
   pct push 16553 /boot/config-$(uname -r) /boot/config-$(uname -r)

   # Package and copy kernel modules directory
   tar cvf /lib/modules/6.8.4-2-pve.tar.gz /lib/modules/6.8.4-2-pve
   pct push 16553 /lib/modules/6.8.4-2-pve.tar.gz /lib/modules/6.8.4-2-pve.tar.gz

   # Extract the archive inside the container
   pct enter 16553
   cd /lib/modules
   tar xvf /lib/modules/6.8.4-2-pve.tar.gz -C /
   ```

## Install on LXC

Run the following installation command inside the LXC container:

``` bash
curl -fsSL https://olares.sh | bash -
```

:::tip Root user password
During the installation, you may be prompted to enter your root password.
:::

:::info Errors during installation?
If an error occurs during installation, use the following command to uninstall first:
```bash
bash olares-uninstall.sh
```
After uninstalling, retry the installation by running the original installation command.
:::

## Prepare Wizard URL

At the end of the installation process, you will be prompted to enter your domain name and Olares ID.

   ![Enter domain name and Olares ID](/images/manual/get-started/enter-olares-id.png)

For example, if your full Olares ID is `alice123@olares.com`:

   - **Domain name**: Press `Enter` to use the default domain name or type `olares.com`.
   - **Olares ID**: Enter the prefix of your Olares ID. In this example, enter `alice123`.

Upon completion of the installation, the initial system information, including the Wizard URL and the initial login password, will appear on the screen. You will need them later in the activation stage.

   b. Reset the login password for Olares by following the on-screen instructions on LarePass.

After successful setup, the LarePass app will automatically go to the home screen, and the Wizard will redirect you to the login page.

## Log in to Olares

Securely access Olares with a two-step verification process.

1. On the login page, enter your Olares login password.

   ![Log in](/images/manual/get-started/log-in.png)
2. You will be prompted to complete the two-factor verification. You can confirm login on LarePass, or manually enter the 6-digit verification code.
   ::: info
   The verification code is time-sensitive. Ensure you enter it before it expires. If it does, you will need to generate a new code.
   :::

   Once you've logged in, you'll be directed to the Olares desktop.ðŸŽ‰

## Next step: Protect your Olares ID

You're almost ready to start using Olares! Before diving in, it's crucial to ensure your Olares ID is securely backed up. Without this step, you won't be able to recover Olares ID if needed.

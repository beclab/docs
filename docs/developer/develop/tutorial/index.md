# Tutorial

Welcome to the Olares developer guides. These detailed tutorials offer a step-by-step guide on building an Olares Application from scratch.

To get started, you can learn some basic concepts of Olares, such as:
- [Olares architectural components](../../../manual/concepts/architecture.md)
- [Olares Application Chart](../../develop/package/chart.md)
- [Olares Extension on Helm](../package/extension.md)

These fundamentals will help you grasp our development process more effectively.

You can also [learn about DevBox](studio.md), a built-in app that Olares provides for developers to build Olares applications.

If you're brand new to Olares development and want to jump straight into coding, start with the [**Create your first Olares app**](./note/index.md). This tutorial will step you through the process of building a small note application.

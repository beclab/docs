# File Upload

There are many situations where you might need to upload local files to your edge when using **Olares**. The `Olares Application Runtime (TAPR)` provides a common file-upload component to simplify this process in app development. Moreover, this file-upload component features **resumable upload**.

## How to install

To use this feature, simply add the following configuration to the [OlaresManifest.yaml](../package/manifest.md#upload) file in TAC.
```yaml
upload:
  fileType:
    - pdf
  dest: /appdata
  limitedSize: 3729747942
```

## Frontend API

:::info NOTE
The limit for a single upload is 10MB. If the file is larger than 10MB, you must upload using the resumable upload API.

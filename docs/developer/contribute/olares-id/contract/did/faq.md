## Transaction Fee

When you apply for a Terminus Name, we can afford the transaction fee for calling the contract. The rough process is:

- You provide us the data and signature signed by your private key
- We send the transaction to the smart contract
- The blockchain records your data after signature verification

If you need to manage data under your domain in the future, you should call the contract via MetaMask. Alternatively, you can log in to Terminus Space using TermiPass and pay the the transaction fee by yourself.

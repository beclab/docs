# Snowinning Protocol

The Snowinning Protocol seeks to establish a decentralized system for identity and credibility, enabling entities—whether individuals or organizations—to independently manage their identities and engage in direct interactions without reliance on a third-party mediator. The goals of this protocol include:

- Enabling each entity to autonomously maintain and control its identity.

- Facilitating the discovery and connection between any two entities within the network.

- Allowing for the secure exchange of information between any two entities, leveraging encrypted communication channels and protocols.
- Enabling transactions and the exchange of value between entities.

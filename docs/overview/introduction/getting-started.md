# Getting Started

Currently, you can try out Terminus in one of two roles:

* **Admin**: Build your own Terminus to enjoy its full capabilities.
* **Member**: Ask your Admin to set up an account for you. As a member, you can access most features and collaborate with other users.

## Admin

If you:

- Have an idle server with more than 8GB of memory and more than 100GB of hard disk space, or
- Have been invited to beta test with Terminus Space's [Host Service](../../how-to/space/index.md#host-service).

You can follow this process to build Terminus. The process is divided into five steps:

1. **Apply for a Terminus Name**

   [Terminus Name](../../developer/contribute/snowinning/terminus-name.md) is your identifier in the world of Terminus. If you don't have one, you need to [apply for a Terminus Name](../../how-to/termipass/account/index.md#create-terminus-name).

2. **Install Terminus**

   - If you are hosting Terminus on your own server, you can [install Terminus with commands](../../how-to/terminus/setup/install.md).
   - If you are installing Terminus via Host Service, refer to [Apply for Terminus on Terminus Space](../../how-to/space/host/create-terminus.md).
   
   At the end of this step, you will get the URL for Terminus and the initial login password.

3. **Activate Terminus**

   Open the Terminus Wizard in your browser using the URL and log in with the one-time password. Follow the instructions to complete the initial setup, including resetting your password and selecting a reverse proxy. Next, use TermiPass to scan the QR code displayed on the screen to activate Terminus. For complete activation guidance, see the [Wizard documentation](../../how-to/terminus/setup/wizard.md).

4. **Log in to Terminus**

   Log in with the password you reset during activation and complete two-step verification on TermiPass. For more information, see the [Login documentation](../../how-to/terminus/setup/login.md).

5. **Backup Account Mnemonic Phrase**

   [Back up your mnemonic phrase](../../how-to/termipass/account/index.md#backup-mnemonic-phrase.md) to ensure account and data security.

## Member

:::info
Contact the Admin of Terminus to determine whether the Terminus you want to join is an individual domain name or an organization domain name. If it is the latter, you need to ask the Admin to confirm the email you used when applying for the Terminus Name.

You can share the [Administrator Manual](../../how-to/terminus/settings/account.md) with your Admin for a clear understanding of the entire process.

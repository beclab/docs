# What is Terminus?

Terminus's mission is to "let people own their data again".

Terminus (used interchangeably with Terminus OS) is a free, self-hosted operating system built on Kubernetes. It converts your edge device into a powerful home cloud, providing powerful cloud computing capabilities while maintaining ease of use and privacy. By securely storing your data and accessing your self-hosted services from anywhere via Terminus OS, you gain complete control over your digital life. 

Terminus is dedicated to advancing technological and AI equality by democratizing capabilities previously accessible only to large companies, making them available to every user.

Terminus consists of three core components and a series of protocols.

## Core components

- [**Snowinning Protocol**](../../developer/contribute/snowinning/overview): A decentralized identity and credit system which provides a framework for secure, trustless exchanges of information and value. 
- [**Terminus OS**](../terminus/overview.md): A cloud-native, source-available operating system based on Kubernetes, running on user-owned edge devices.
- [**TermiPass**](../../how-to/termipass/overview.md): A client software that securely bridges users to their Terminus systems across devices.
 
## Protocols

In the future decentralized world, platforms may no longer exist, but protocols will remain. In addition to the Snowinning Protocol, we provide three protocol prototypes that back the Terminus ecosystem:

- [**Otmoic Protocol**](../protocol/otmoic.md): A protocol based on Request For Quote (RFQ) and on-chain reputation to provide prices and exchange values for public goods.
- [**Market Protocol**](../protocol/market.md): A permissionless app distribution protocol that eliminates the need for stringent reviews and commissions by intermediaries like Apple.
- [**Recommend Protocol**](../protocol/recommend.md): A decentralized and privacy-protecting information distribution protocol designed to free you from the information bubble.
 
## Use Cases

- **Self-Hosted**: Terminus OS serves as a one-stop self-hosted solution where users can host and manage their data, operations, and digital life effectively, with full data ownership.

- **Local AI**: With the [AI Framework](../terminus/ai.md) provided by Terminus, users can host and run world-class open-source AI models locally, including large language models, image generation, and speech recognition. This allows the capability to create custom AI assistants that integrate seamlessly with  personal data and applications, all while ensuring enhanced privacy and control.

- **Personal data repository**: Securely store, sync, and manage your photos, documents, and important files in a unified storage and access anywhere. 

- **Self-hosted workspace**: Create a free, powerful workspace for your team or family with open source selfhosted alternatives. 

- **Private media server**: Host your own streaming services with your personal media collections. 

- **Smart Home Hub**: Create a central control point for your IoT devices and home automation.  

- **User-owned decentralized social media**: Easily install decentralized social media apps such as Mastodon, Ghost, and WordPress on Terminus OS, allowing you to build a personal brand without the risk of being banned or paying platform commissions.

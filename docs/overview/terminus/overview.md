# Terminus OS

Terminus OS is a free, source-available, cloud-native operating system based on Kubernetes, designed for both individuals and enterprises.

In this era of rapid technological change, Terminus OS is dedicated to advancing technological and AI equality by democratizing capabilities previously accessible only to large companies, making them available to every user.

You can learn about the system in its entirety through the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/beclab/terminus).

## Introduction

With the development of AI, people are increasingly concerned about their privacy.

Terminus OS helps individuals and businesses effectively manage their data, businesses, and everyday life.

- For users, our aim is to make Terminus OS as user-friendly as their smartphones.
- For developers, we strive to provide an experience on Terminus OS that aligns with what they experience on public clouds.

We understand that achieving this goal is challenging. However, over the past decade, with the emergence of cloud-native technologies represented by Kubernetes, the time and expertise required for individual users to manage a small server cluster have become more accessible.

Terminus OS's development relies on numerous third-party projects, such as: [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/), [Kubesphere](https://github.com/kubesphere/kubesphere), [Padloc](https://padloc.app/), [K3S](https://k3s.io/), [JuiceFS](https://github.com/juicedata/juicefs), [MinIO](https://github.com/minio/minio), [Envoy](https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy), [Authelia](https://github.com/authelia/authelia), [Infisical](https://github.com/Infisical/infisical), [Dify](https://github.com/langgenius/dify), [Seafile](https://github.com/haiwen/seafile).

# Secrets

## Motivation

Secrets require cautious management.

We aim to track who can access them, who are utilizing them, and how secret rotations are performed.

However, in practice, we have observed widespread secret dissemination. Secrets are becoming pervasive, appearing in plaintext within source code, configuration management tools like Chef, Puppet, Ansible, and eventually making their way into version control systems such as GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket. Ultimately, they are dispersed throughout our infrastructure, accessible to anyone with login credentials.

Olares OS categorizes `secrets` based on usage scenarios and employs various management techniques.

## Integration Credential

- Users can grant applications within Olares OS access to credentials by [logging into third-party service accounts](../../how-to/olares/settings/integration.md#third-party-account), within Settings. For instance:

  - Logging into Olares Space allows the Backup program to request tokens for automated backend backups.

  - Logging into Google enables the File program to synchronize with Google Drive data.

- Applications in Olares OS can acquire third-party service credentials integrated in Settings via [Service Provider](../../developer/develop/advanced/provider.md).

## Application Credential

- Applications can manage and utilize [Credential](../../developer/develop/advanced/secret.md) through Olares OS-provided interfaces.
- Credentials generated by an application are exclusively for its own use.

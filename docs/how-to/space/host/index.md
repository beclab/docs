# Host

Here, you can manage your Olares devices that have been bound to Olares IDs and activated. There are two types of Olares devices:

- **Self-Hosted Olares**, which is set up on your own device.

- **Cloud-based Olares**, deployed using our **Host Service**.

If you do not yet have an Olares, please refer to [Getting Started](../../../overview/introduction/getting-started/) to learn how to obtain one.

# Host

Here, you can manage your Terminus devices that have been bound to Terminus Names and activated. There are two types of Terminus devices:

- **Self-Hosted Terminus**, which is set up on your own device.

- **Cloud-based Terminus**, deployed using our **Host Service**.

If you do not yet have a Terminus, please refer to [Getting Started](../../../overview/introduction/getting-started/) to learn how to obtain one.

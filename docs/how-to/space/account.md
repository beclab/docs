## Log In

**Olares Space** uses Decentralized ID (DID) for user authentication, ensuring that users maintain control over their identity and data ownership. 

:::info
Your **Olares ID** is your identifier in the world of Olares. Learn more about [what is Olares ID](../../developer/contribute/snowinning/olares-id.md).
:::

To log into Olares Space, you'll need your **DID** or **Olares ID**. Obtain your credentials using the LarePass client and scan the QR code to log in.

The screenshots above show three places on **LarePass** where you can scan the QR code to log into **Olares Space**:

- The result page displayed after creating your **DID**.
- The landing page after you've bound your **Olares ID**.
- The **Settings** page that appears after successfully activating your **Olares**.

For more information about your account, refer to the [account details](../larepass/account/index.md).

## Account Type

You can log into **Olares Space** using either a **DID** or a **Olares ID**. However, the features and services available on **Olares Space** will vary based on the `account type`.

- **DID**: <br>
  When you log in with this account type, you cannot create a **Olares** until you bind a **Olares ID**. However, you have the option to set your own domain because no domain has been bound yet.


- **Olares ID**:<br>
When you log in with this account type, you should be able to create a **Olares**, unless your **Olares ID** is already bound to another **Olares**. However, you will not be able to set your own domain, as the **Olares ID** is already associated with a domain.

## Manage Multiple Accounts

Each **Olares ID** can be bound to just one **Olares**. With **Multi-account Management** in **Olares Space**, you can easily switch between accounts. This is handy if you own multiple **Olares IDs** and **Olares** instances.

To add an account:

1. Click the avatar in the top-right corner.
2. Select **Import Account** from the pop-up menu.

Once you've added several accounts, you can switch between them using the **'Switch Account'** option in the pop-up menu. If the account you're switching to is logged out, you'll be redirected to the QR code login page.

To log out of your account:

1. Click your avatar in the top-right corner.
2. Click **Log Out**.

Alternatively, you can:

1. Choose **Switch Account** from the menu.

Logging out will only clear this account's login records in this browser; it won't change any account data.

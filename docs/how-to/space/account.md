**Terminus Space** uses Decentralized ID (DID) for user authentication, ensuring that users maintain control over their identity and data ownership. 

:::info
Your **Terminus Name** is your identifier in the world of Terminus. Learn more about [what is Terminus Name](../../overview/snowinning/terminus-name.md).
:::

To log into Terminus Space, you'll need your **DID** or **Terminus Name**. Obtain your credentials using the TermiPass client and scan the QR code to log in.

The screenshots above show three places on **TermiPass** where you can scan the QR code to log into **Terminus Space**:

- The result page displayed after creating your **DID**.
- The landing page after you've bound your **Terminus Name**.
- The **Settings** page that appears after successfully activating your **Terminus**.

For more information about your account, refer to the [account details](../termipass/account/index.md).

## Account Type

You can log into **Terminus Space** using either a **DID** or a **Terminus Name**. However, the features and services available on **Terminus Space** will vary based on the `account type`.

- **DID**: <br>
  When you log in with this account type, you cannot create a **Terminus** until you bind a **Terminus Name**. However, you have the option to set your own domain because no domain has been bound yet.


- **Terminus Name**:<br>
When you log in with this account type, you should be able to create a **Terminus**, unless your **Terminus Name** is already bound to another **Terminus**. However, you will not be able to set your own domain, as the **Terminus Name** is already associated with a domain.

## Manage Multiple Accounts

Each **Terminus Name** can be bound to just one **Terminus**. With **Multi-account Management** in **Terminus Space**, you can easily switch between accounts. This is handy if you own multiple **Terminus Names** and **Terminus** instances.

Once you've added several accounts, you can switch between them using the **'Switch Account'** option in the pop-up menu. If the account you're switching to is logged out, you'll be redirected to the QR code login page.

1. Click your avatar in the top-right corner.
2. Click **Log Out**.

# Domain


## Using a Custom Domain with Olares

If you're an organizational user, you might prefer your employees to use company-specific domain names for login instead of a public domain. In such cases, you can apply for your own **Domain** and bind it.

## Why can't I bind a new domain?

A new domain can only be bound if the account is in the **DID** stage. If the account has already been bound with a **Olares ID**, it means that the account is already associated with a **Domain**. In this case, you won't be able to switch to a new one.

You can create a new DID and then use this DID to log into **Olares Space** and set up your own **Domain**. Follow these steps:

1. Apply for a domain name on cloud.
2. Set up DNS configuration.
3. Apply for an account on **LarePass** and bind the **Domain** name
4. Apply for a **Olares ID** under this **Domain**.
5. Proceed with the installation.
6. Access Olares through the **Custom Domain**.

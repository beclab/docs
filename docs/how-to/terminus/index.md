Terminus OS is a source-available, cloud-native operating system. It's based on Kubernetes and runs on edge devices owned by users. Our aim is to allow users to securely store their most important data on their own hardware devices and access valuable services based on this private data from anywhere in the world.

In essence, we want you to use Terminus like a common computer. We hope that Terminus OS can assist individuals and organizations in managing data, business, and life effectively.

We've incorporated a variety of apps into Terminus OS to cater to your basic needs. There is also a Market application where you can install various applications, recommendation algorithms, and large language models from Terminus and third-party developers with one click.

This chapter serves as a user manual for the system's pre-installed software in [Terminus OS](../../overview/terminus/overview.md). You can choose the applications you're interested in to learn more.

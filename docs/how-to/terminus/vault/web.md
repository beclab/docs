# Running Vault On Terminus For The First Time

To maintain consistency and proper functionality across all platforms, you'll need to set up a lock password for Vault and bind the correct Terminus Name.

## Step 1: Set Up Vaultâ€™s Lock Password

To ensure a strong and secure password, our password policy is as follows:
- Length of 8-32 characters
- Contains lowercase letters
- Contains uppercase letters
- Contains numbers
- Contains symbols

If your password does not meet these requirements, you won't be able to complete the password setup step.

## Step 2: Import Your Terminus Name Mnemonic

At this stage, you can only bind the **Terminus Name** account already linked with this Terminus device. If you've forgotten your mnemonic phrase, you can find it in the **TermiPass** mobile client after logging into Terminus.

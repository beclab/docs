# Knowledge Base

This section explains how to configure knowledge bases to enhance the accuracy of your Dify Agents.

Each knowledge base monitors one or more file directories on Terminus. By configuring the knowledge base for an **Agent** in [Dify](../dify.md), you can improve the accuracy of the Agent's answers using your own data.

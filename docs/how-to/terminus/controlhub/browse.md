# Browse

The **Browse** pane provides an application view to let you quickly locate resource usages related to an application.

![alt text](/images/how-to/terminus/controlhub/browse/01.jpg)

## Namespace

In the **Browse** pane, the first column is `Namespace`. It categorizes different namespaces into **User Projects** and **System Projects**.

- **User Projects**:<br>
  Include each user's independent namespace. Namespaces prefixed with `user-space` are built-in applications for users. Those prefixed with `user-system` are user-related system programs or components, typically TAPR components, scheduling and proxy programs for cross-application interaction within a user's applications.

- **System Projects**:<br>
Include the core applications of the Terminus OS system cluster, along with system-level service programs. For instance, within `os-system`, there are a **Middleware** database that serves the entire cluster, a system-level **Vault** application, and **Authelia**, a cluster-wide SSO service.

:::tip
Member can only see projects under their own `User Projects`, while admin can see projects under `System Projects` as well as projects under all user's namespaces.

## Project Resources

Terminus organizes project resources using a three-column layout for easy navigation and management.

Click on a namespace to expand the middle column that contains all resource types within the namespace. These resources include `Workload`, `Service`, `ConfigMap`, `Secret`, and `ServiceAccount` for applications.

Clicking on any resource name will expand its detailed information in the third column. The details may vary depending on the type of resource.

### Workloads

 In Terminus OS, **Workloads** represent applications running on your Terminus OS cluster. They correspond to three primary resource types in Kubernetes:

- **Deployment**<br>
 `Deployment` is the most common workload type in Kubernetes. It automatically generates a `ReplicaSet` to schedule and generate Pods, creating more Pod replicas for horizontal scaling.

- **StatefulSet**<br>
  `StatefulSet` is typically used to deploy `stateful` Pods, such as Pods for databases, distributed file storage, or in-memory caching. With **StatefulSet**, each Pod may hold different data, resulting in Pods with different states. Therefore, **StatefulSet** often schedules Pods sequentially.

- **DaemonSet**<br>
  A `DaemonSet` schedules and runs only one Pod on each node. In other words, the number of Pods generated by a daemon set is usually equal to the number of nodes. Therefore, **DaemonSet** is also used for node-specific hardware operations.

### View Resource Details
![alt text](/images/how-to/terminus/controlhub/browse/02.jpg)

Click on a workload resource to view the details of a deployment, the content is as follows:

| **Section**               | **Description**               |

| **Labels**                | Configured in the `workload` metadata; Used for controller management coordination in Terminus OS. Can also act as indexes for filtering and selecting resources in Kubernetes                                        |
| **Annotations**           | Similar to labels but more flexible and character range. Serve as a tool for controllers to manage workloads                                    |
| **Events**                | Log of events related to the workload within the latest one hour, often showing Pod scheduling status. <br>Click the **Refresh** button to get the latest updates                         |


You can click on the name of a Pod to learn the detailed information of a Pod, as shown in the table below:

### Modify Pod Replicas

To modify the number of running Pod replicas:  

1. In the resource details page, locate the number of Pod replicas at the top. 
2. Adjust the number of Pod replicas using the **+** or **-** button. 
  
    ![replicas](/images/how-to/terminus/controlhub/browse/09.jpg)

:::warning
Many applications in Terminus OS do not support multi-replica mode. Increasing the number of replicas for these Pods may cause exceptions. Therefore, it's important to read the documentation thoroughly and adjust the number of replicas with caution.
:::

### Edit the YAML File

To edit the YAML file of the current workload:

1. In the upper right corner of the resource details page, click the **More Options** menu. 
2. Click the **Edit YAML** option to open the **Edit YAML** window.
3. Edit the YAML configuration of the workload as needed. 
4. Click **OK** to save your changes and apply them.

    ![edit yaml](/images/how-to/terminus/controlhub/browse/10.jpg)

## Secrets

The **Secrets** section stores sensitive data like passwords, credentials, and key configurations. In Kubernetes, this data is Base64 encoded by default.

![secrets](/images/how-to/terminus/controlhub/browse/11.jpg)

Expand the **Secrets** section in the second column to see the all secrets under the application's namespace. Click an item to view the details:

- **Details**: Displays the basic information of the secret, including the namespace it belongs to and the creation time.
- **Data**: This section displays the **Data Key** and **Data Value** of the secret.

::: tip
The **Data Value** shown by default is the `Base64` encoded. You can click the **preview** button at the top right of this section to see the original text.
:::

## ConfigMap

The **ConfigMap** section has a structure similar to **Secrets**. However, the content stored in the **ConfigMap** is saved in plaintext.

![configmaps](/images/how-to/terminus/controlhub/browse/12.jpg)

Likewise, you can expand the **ConfigMaps** section in the second column to view the details of the **ConfigMaps** under the application's namespace:

- **Details**: Shows the basic information of the **ConfigMap**, including the namespace and creation time.
- **Data**: Displays the **Data Key** and **Data Value** of the **ConfigMap**.

## Service Account

**Service Accounts** is a Kubernetes mechanism to authenticate cluster container applications, enabling their access to cluster resources managed by **Kubernetes**.


Each **Service Account** is linked to a **Secret**. This **Secret** includes the **Service Account's** `CA certificate`, `Namespace`, and `Token`.

![Service accounts](/images/how-to/terminus/controlhub/browse/13.jpg)

You can expand the second column on the **Service Accounts** section to view all the **Service Accounts** under the application's namespace. Click an item to access the details page:

- **Details**: Shows the basic information of the **Service Account**, including the namespace it belongs to, creation time, etc.
- **Data**: Displays the **Data Key** and **Data Value** of the **Secret** linked to this **Service Account**.
- **Kubeconfig Settings**:<br>
  It is the kubeconfig configuration automatically generated by this **Service Account**. Developers can download this configuration and incorporate it into an application within the container. Alternatively, an application in the container can read the **Service Account configuration** injected by **Kubernetes** at `/var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/`.


## Services

**Services** expose network applications running on a single or a group of Pods as network services. They distribute traffic based on defined Selectors.

A Selector uses Labels to filter and select Pods. Essentially, a Service acts as a virtual IP (VIP) that directs traffic to a single Pod or a group of Pods.

![service1](/images/how-to/terminus/controlhub/browse/14.jpg)

Expand the **Services** section in the second column to view all the Services` under the namespace of the current application.
Click a service item to see the details page.

|---------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Details**  | Shows basic information of the Service, including its namespace, creation time, selector, virtual IP, type, and DNS address |

# Login

If you open an application in Terminus without system authorization or if your authorization has expired, your browser will automatically redirect you to the login page. You simply need to:

1. Enter your Terminus login password
2. Input the **Two-factor Verification code**

After a successful login, you won't need to authorize again when accessing other applications in Terminus.

## Enter Password

Input your Terminus login password. If the password is incorrect, the input box will shake side to side as a reminder.

If you enter the incorrect password more than **3** times, your account will be temporarily locked. You will need to wait **5 minutes** before you can attempt to log in again.

- You can change your password in [Settings](../settings/home.md#change-password).
- If you forget your login password, you can contact your administrator to reset it.

## Two-factor Verification

After entering your login password correctly, the system will prompt you for the **Two-factor Verification Code**. There are two ways to complete the Two-factor Verification.

### Confirm via TermiPass

A dialogue box will pop up in **TermiPass**. Click **'Confirm'** to complete the Two-factor Verification.

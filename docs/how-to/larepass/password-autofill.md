To enable the autofill service on Android, navigate to **LarePass** > **Setting**, and turn on **Autofill** toggle.

### Autosave

Once the Autofill service is enabled, **LarePass** will prompt you to save your username and password when you enter them in an app.

- Press **Confirm** to automatically save the credentials to **Vault**.
- Press **Cancel** to skip this Autosave.

### Autofill

Autofill will be triggered if you have saved the username and password for an app:

1. A **LarePass** dialog appears when you click on the username or password box during your next login. 
2. Unlock LarePass to select the corresponding credentials from the Vault list.
3. When you switch back to the app interface, the username and password fields have been autofilled.

## Password Autofill on iOS

Due to system restrictions, iOS autofill works differently than Android.

### Save Credentials

To save credentials for your iOS app:

1. On your iPhone, go to iOS **Settings** > **Passwords**, tap AutoFill Passwords, and enable LarePass as an autofill option.
2. When you need to enter your credentials in any app, a key icon will appear on the keyboard. Click on it, and you will see **LarePass** in the list. 
3. Select **LarePass** and unlock it to add the username and password into the Vault manually.

Alternatively, you can open **LarePass** directly and save your username and password to the Vault at any time.

### Autofill

To autofill saved credentials on an iOS app:
1. In the login interface of the app, click on the key icon, and select LarePass as your autofill option.
2. Unlock **LarePass**, then choose the **Vaults Item** that contains your login credentials. This will automatically fill the related fields in the app.

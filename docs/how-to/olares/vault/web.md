# Running Vault On Olares For The First Time

To maintain consistency and proper functionality across all platforms, you'll need to set up a lock password for Vault and bind the correct Olares ID.

## Step 1: Set Up Vaultâ€™s Lock Password

To ensure a strong and secure password, our password policy is as follows:
- Length of 8-32 characters
- Contains lowercase letters
- Contains uppercase letters
- Contains numbers
- Contains symbols

If your password does not meet these requirements, you won't be able to complete the password setup step.

## Step 2: Import Your Olares ID Mnemonic

At this stage, you can only bind the **Olares ID** account already linked with this Olares device. If you've forgotten your mnemonic phrase, you can find it in the **LarePass** mobile client after logging into Olares.

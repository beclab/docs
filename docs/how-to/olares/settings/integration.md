## Olares Space Account

Each **Olares ID** is associated with a **Olares Space account**. You can log into Olares Space using the **LarePass** application by scanning the QR code.

Once you have logged in to **Olares Space**, you will be able to view detailed system data information if you have logged in before.

For more information, please refer to [Management Olares](../../space/host/management-olares.md).

### Import Blockchain Wallet

To use NFT images as unique avatars in your profile, you need to bind a blockchain wallet. You can find **MetaMask** in the **Chrome Web Store**. After installing the extension, create or import your blockchain wallet. Then, click the **'Import'** button to import your wallet.

### Bind Blockchain Wallet

After importing the wallet, the page will refresh to display the imported wallet fields. Now you can click the **Bound** button to trigger the **MetaMask** wallet authorization. Once the binding process is completed, a message will be sent to your **LarePass** mobile app. Click **Bound** again to bind the wallet to your Olares ID.

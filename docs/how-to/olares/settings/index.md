# Settings

We designed the **Settings** application, inspired by mobile operating systems. It is a powerful assistant for managing and configuring Olares.

In the **Settings**, there are:
1. [Home](./home.md), to manage your account security.
2. [Account](./account.md), to manage users in Olares.
3. [Application](./application.md), to monitor and configure application statuses.
4. [Integration](./integration.md), to integrate Internet-based third-party services with Olares OS.
5. [Wallpaper](./wallpaper.md), to set Desktop and Login screen backgrounds.
6. [Knowledge](./knowledge.md), to configure the Agent's knowledge base.
7. [Backup](./backup.md), to set up Olares backups.
8. [Upgrade](./upgrade.md), to upgrades the system.
